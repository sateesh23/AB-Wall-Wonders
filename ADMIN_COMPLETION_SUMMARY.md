## 🔧 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO COMPLETE THE SETUP

### Step 1: Deploy Your Website

1. **Push code to GitHub**
2. **Deploy to Vercel/Netlify**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist`
3. **Your admin will be available at**: `https://your-domain.com/admin`

### Step 2: Deploy Sanity Studio (Required for Full CMS)

**Option A: Use Sanity's Hosting (Recommended)**

```bash
cd sanity-backend
npx sanity login    # Login with your Sanity account
npx sanity deploy   # Deploy to https://g5scqowd.sanity.studio/
```

**Option B: The admin panel will work without Sanity**

- Projects will be stored in browser localStorage
- Still fully functional for project management
- Can upgrade to Sanity later

### Step 3: Test Complete Workflow

1. Visit `https://your-domain.com/admin`
2. Login with password: `abwallwonders2025`
3. Create a test project
4. Verify it appears on your website
